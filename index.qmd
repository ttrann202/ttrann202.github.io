# Welcome, thank you for stopping by!

I am a researcher specializing in applied social and health psychology. My objective is to formulate and validate robust statistical frameworks aimed at comprehending intricate interactions among various socio-ecological elements, and ultimately, help promote a wholesome and purposeful existence for individuals. While my research has been primarily quantitatively driven, I am actively incorporating more qualitative and mixed method approaches in my present and future work to garner more holistic understanding of human experiences.
